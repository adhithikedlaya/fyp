# Exploring Brain Hemodynamics: fitting a physiologically informed dynamic causal model for functional MRI data - the codebase!

- see time_series to see the empirical BOLD signals, extracted from [this dataset](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003059/versions/1.0.0) using the Schaeffer 100 parcellation.

- the code for the inital spectral method of fitting can be found in spectral_fitting

- see scipy_models for the code for the baseline time-domain method using sk-opt

- see pytorch_models for the main time-domain method code and results
